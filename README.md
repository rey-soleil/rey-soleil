### Hi, I'm Rey! ğŸ‘‹

I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2019, and since then I've worked at Google and at various startups. 
I'm currently attending a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
- ğŸ’¬ [ezra](https://github.com/rey-soleil/what-do-i-know): an openai-assisted chatbot that helps users map their mind
- ğŸ“† [things-take-time](https://github.com/rey-soleil/things-take-time): a time management web app that integrates with Google Calendar + Todoist
