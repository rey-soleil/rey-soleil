### Hi, I'm Rey! 👋

I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2019, and since then I've worked at Google and at various startups. 
I'm currently attending a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

🔭 I’m currently working on...
- 🌈 [feels](https://github.com/rey-soleil/feels): a web app for logging moods
- 📆 [the next right thing](https://github.com/rey-soleil/next-right-thing): a time management web app that integrates with Google Calendar + Todoist
- ✍️ writer's blocks (WIP!): an open-ai assisted tool for helping writers get started on a project
